### Project Description
Paw Voices is a playful, useless-yet-fun web app that lets you "hear" your pets’ fake complaints in a letter-style format.  
By entering your pet's name and species (and optionally uploading a photo), the app generates random, witty complaint messages written from your pet’s perspective.  

Because let's be real: if pets could talk, they'd probably roast us.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
 There’s no light-hearted platform to “translate” pets’ silent judgment into humor in a playful and shareable way.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We’re solving it by creating Paw Voices
