# Paw voices 🎯


## Basic Details

### Project Description
Paw Voices is a playful, useless-yet-fun web app that lets you "hear" your pets’ fake complaints in a letter-style format.  
By entering your pet's name and species (and optionally uploading a photo), the app generates random, witty complaint messages written from your pet’s perspective.  

Because let's be real: if pets could talk, they'd probably roast us.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
 There’s no light-hearted platform to “translate” pets’ silent judgment into humor in a playful and shareable way.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We’re solving it by creating Paw Voices

What the Paw Voices Website Does:
Takes User Input:
Users enter their pet’s name and species (e.g., dog, cat) and can optionally upload a photo of their pet.

Generates Funny Complaints:
The site uses a library of 100+ prewritten humorous complaint templates that insert the pet's name and species dynamically.

Displays in Letter Format:
Each complaint appears in a styled “handwritten note” box, making it look like a real letter from the pet.

Randomized & Replayable:
Users can click “Generate Another Complaint” to keep seeing new, randomized pet complaints.
