# Paw voices üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Akasha


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Joel THomas - MBCCET
- Member 2: Amal Babu - MBCCET

### Project Description
Paw Voices is a playful, useless-yet-fun web app that lets you "hear" your pets‚Äô fake complaints in a letter-style format.  
By entering your pet's name and species (and optionally uploading a photo), the app generates random, witty complaint messages written from your pet‚Äôs perspective.  

Because let's be real: if pets could talk, they'd probably roast us.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
 There‚Äôs no light-hearted platform to ‚Äútranslate‚Äù pets‚Äô silent judgment into humor in a playful and shareable way.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We‚Äôre solving it by creating Paw Voices
